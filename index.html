                    Harry Potter, fictional character, a boy wizard created by British author J.K. Rowling. His
                    coming-of-age exploits were the subject of seven enormously popular novels (1997 - 2007), which were
                    adapted into eight films (2001 - 11); a play and a book of its script appeared in 2016

                <p>
                    On Halloween night in 1981, Lord Voldemort ventured to Godric's Hollow with the intent of killing
                    Harry. James Potter was killed trying to save his wife and child. Lily Potter then shielded her
                    infant son when Voldemort unleashed the Killing Curse, causing it to bounce back and disintegrate
                    his physical body. Harry survived but was left with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead and a
                    nickname: "The Boy Who Lived."
                </p>

                <p>
                    One reason that Harry lived after being hit by the Harry Potter Killing Curse in Harry Potter and
                    the Deathly Hallows is his mastery of the Elder Wand. There was a belief that obtaining the Deathly
                    Hallows would grant the finder some sort of immortality. The Deathly Hallows were directly connected
                    to the legend from The Tales of Beedle the Bard. In the tale, the Peverell brothers tricked Death,
                    who in return offered them "gifts" intended to corrupt them and lead to their deaths. The rewards
                    included the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Invisibility Cloak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Harry notably possessed all three items that comprised the Deathly Hallows when Voldemort tried to
                    kill him the night of the Battle of Hogwarts. He received the Cloak of Invisibility from his father,
                    James, and obtained the Resurrection Stone from Dumbledore after it was hidden in a snitch. While
                    it's unclear whether there's any truth to the "Master of Death" being immortal, the Elder Wand will
                    resist causing harm to its master â€” who, via a roundabout series of events, was Harry.

                Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff
                and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards
                and witches as well as to keep students safe from muggle persecution. Theory has it that Rowena
                Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a
                lake.[4] Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and
                Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles.<br>
                Hogwarts houses include: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.

                <p>
                    Wizardkind are humans born with the ability to use magic. An individual male human with magical
                    ability, is known as a wizard (plural: wizards), and an individual female human with magical ability
                    is known as a witch, though "wizard" is sometimes used as a gender-neutral singular noun like "man".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The origins of wizardkind is unknown. Whether, in ancient times, some humans randomly discovered
                    they had magic, some extraterrestrial beings or objects came with magic, or there was some sort of
                    ritual or potion or pact, their origins remained a mystery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To perform controlled magic, almost all wizards/witches needed to use a wand, although the advanced
                    skill of wandless magic may have been mastered in later life. A few highly advanced wizards could do
                    controlled magical feats without a wand, such as Albus Dumbledore, who demonstrated the ability in
                    Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Lord Voldemort, who
                    once demonstrated this ability during the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997.

                <p>
                    A Muggle is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family.
                    Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood inside them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some Muggles are aware of the wizarding world. These include Muggle parents of magical children,
                    such as Hermione Granger's parents, the Muggle Prime Minister (and predecessors), the Dursley family
                    (Harry Potter's unsupportive non-magical and only living relatives), and the non-magical spouses of
                    some witches and wizards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Mudblood" is an offensive derogatory slur of prejudice used to refer to wizards and witches who are
                    closely related to muggles. While it is usually specifically targeted at witches and wizards with
                    non-magical parents, called muggle-borns, it is also used to address people with half-blood
                    parentage, where one of the parents is a wizard or witch. It is mostly used as an insult by
                    pure-blooded wizards who support the cause of pure-blood supremacy

            <article>
                <p>
                    House-elves are small creatures with big eyes and bat-like ears, and are usually very poorly
                    clothed. They can often be found at large houses and mansions. They are supposed to be very loyal to
                    the head of their family. An owner or master can 'free' a house elf by giving him or her clothes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When looking deeper, House-Elves are essentially slaves. Not only that, but there is an aspect to
                    their characterization that leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouths of many readers. In The Goblet
                    of Fire, Hermione attempts to pay some House-Elves for their service. The creatures took this
                    gesture as an insult, refusing to clean the dormitories in protest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dobby's obsession with freedom seems understandable to readers, but to other House-Elves, he's in
                    the minority. As previously mentioned, House-Elves apparently crave submission. Dobby is the only
                    one who wants freedom and payment, and because of this, he is ostracized by his fellow elves. RIP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although House-Elves are regulated to a servant class, that does not mean that they are without
                    power. House-Elves are full of magical abilities which occasionally dwarf those of witches and
                    wizards. Throughout Harry Potter, House-Elves show their talent for telekinesis and apparating.
                    Their powers are so strong that they can throw full-grown adults with their telekinesis, as well as
                    apparate places witches and wizards are not allowed to.

            <header>Goblins</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Goblins are a highly intelligent race of small hominids with long fingers and feet that coexist with
                    wizards. Their diet consists of meat, roots and fungi. Goblins converse in a language known as
                    Gobbledegook, and are adept metalsmiths notable for their silverwork; they even mint coins for
                    wizarding currency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goblins had their own type of magic and could do magic without a wand. They were represented by the
                    Goblin Liaison Office of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures in the
                    British Ministry of Magic. Goblins were considered to be inferior by many wizards, who foolishly
                    believed that the goblins were comfortable with that arrangement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goblins were extremely clever and over the years had dealt with wizard-kind effectively. They were
                    still subservient in the minds of most wizards, but they had established themselves as a vital part
                    of wizarding society. The goblins ran Gringotts, the wizarding bank. Therefore, they controlled the
                    wizarding economy to a large extent.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Dragons have always been an integral part of fantasy and fiction, with many cool dragons gracing
                    television shows, movies, and books. The magical world of Harry Potter is no different, with dragons
                    being one of the most feared magical creatures that exist in the wizarding world. Introduced in
                    Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, in the form of Norbert, aquired by Hagrid, many dragons
                    have since then made an appearance in the stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite being the most famous magical beast to exist in this world, even regular wizards do not risk
                    keeping a dragon in their household (except for Hagrid...) and leave the care of these creatures to
                    professionals known as Dragonologists. The primary reason for this is that dragons are temperamental
                    and quite dangerous. The second reason is that even among wizards, not many know about them in
                    detail or how to care for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other animals, dragons have a unique method of incubating their eggs. As revealed by Hagrid,
                    from what he had read in the antiquated Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit, dragon mothers do
                    not keep their eggs inside nests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To incubate them, and make them ready for hatching, these mothers are known to breathe fire on their
                    eggs, an alternative of which could be placing them on direct fire or a burning-hot utensil hung
                    over the fire, as Hagrid had done with Norbert. Upon hatching, a dragon chick usually craves dragon
                    milk, which if not available can be replaced by a mixture of brandy and chicken blood. This
                    concoction needs to be fed to the young dragon once every half an hour.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Dementors are dark creatures that consume human happiness, creating an ambiance of coldness,
                    darkness, misery and despair. Because of their power to drain happiness and hope from humans, they
                    have been set the duty of being guards at Azkaban, where they prevent the prisoners from having the
                    will or ability to escape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This creature has the property that only wizards can see it. Muggles can still feel them, though.
                    Its only known ability, besides the happiness drain, is the ability to perform the "Dementor's
                    Kiss", which is the act of extracting the human soul through the mouth, leaving nothing more than a
                    living body, without any memory, feelings, or sense of self. This process is irreversible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only spell we are aware of which is able to repel these creatures, is called the Patronus charm.
                    In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, when Harry asserts that the Patronus charm is the only
                    way to battle Dementors, Professor Snape tells him that he is wrong; but this supposed different way
                    of tackling Dementors is never described.

            <header>Death Eaters</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The Death Eaters are characters featured in the Harry Potter series of novels and films. They are a
                    radical group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who seek to purify the
                    wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They attempt to create a new order within the Ministry of Magic by spreading fear through the
                    wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them. Their primary opposition is the
                    Order of the Phoenix, which included both of Harry Potters Parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Death Eaters recognise one another by the Dark Mark, a sigil branded on each of their left forearms
                    that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voldemort's Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic. They follow a
                    racist ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a racial hierarchy, above all other
                    magical or non-magical people and entities. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the
                    story phrases it, "Nature's Nobility"; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and
                    should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, only those who are born to wizard parents are
                    worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such
                    powers.

                    They categorise wizards according to blood purity; "pure bloods" (those with only wizards as
                    parents) out-rank "half-bloods" (mixed parentage) and "mudbloods", a derogatory name for those born
                    to non-magical parents (Muggles). Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them.
                    Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as Sirius Black, the
                    Prewett brothers, who were murdered because of their loyalties, and the entire Weasley family. Such
                    people are often called "blood traitors" by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies.
